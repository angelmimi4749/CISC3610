            <h3>Cartoon Project</h3>
            <p>Instructions: <br><br> 
                Using a HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript, draw some cartoon on the screen using moveTo, lineTo, fill, stroke, and other JavaScript canvas functions.<br><br>
                - Add a link from your portfolio page to the cartoon.<br>
                - Cartoon page must have a title. Include a link under the canvas to return to your main page.<br>
                - You should use an external JS file for your JavaScript code.<br>
                - Comment the different sections of your cartoon using JS comments, so that someone can easily understand what is being drawn.<br><br>
                *** Your cartoon should include: <br>
                - Some caption text (must be written on the canvas!)<br>
                - Background color<br>
                - Sun, Moon, Clouds, Water, Mountains, Trees, and/or other background objects<br>
                - Ground color<br>
                - Living Quarters with details (windows, door, etc). Could be a boat, tent, house, spaceship, etc.<br>
                - Use a for loop to draw grass, rocks, fence, ladder, or some other receptive item in the cartoon.<br> <br>
                Helpful sites:<br>
                Refer to the HTML5 book Chapter 8 for details on how to draw.<br>

            <h3>Color Chart Program</h3>
            <p>Instructions: <br> <br> 
                Store the following values in a JSON array in JavaScript.<br> 
                - Strawberry:15
                - Peach: 10
                - Banana:25
                - Pear: 10
                - Grape: 20<br> <br> 
                JSON in JavaScript example is best. Here it is partially, to help start you off. <br> 
                var fruit = [ {name:"Strawberry", quantity:15, color:"red"}, {name:"Peach", quantity:10, color:"orange"} ];<br> <br> 
                Using Javascript/Canvas, read in the JSON values, using a loop to draw out a bar chart showing the quantity in sales for the fruit. Each bar should be in a color that matches the fruit, please choose a unique color for each fruit.<br> 

                <br>  Write the name of the fruit, followed by the bar chart. You can choose horizontal or vertical. <br> <br> 

                Refer to the following examples for help: <br> 
                https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_arrays.asp <br>

            <h3>Animation Project</h3>
            <p>Instruction: <br><br>
                Animation - Make an animated scene<br>
                Please set the viewport as follows   <textarea rows="1" cols="70"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> </textarea> <br><br>

                You can use still images, if that is easier for you. But if you want to be more creative and learn about Sprite Sheets or working with Animated GIFs on a Canvas, this can be more challenging.<br>
                - Have a background.<br>
                - Have talk bubbles appear for people/animals/vechicles to say things.<br>
                - Change or reposition some items in your scene in different frames.  <br>
                - Make an animated scene lasting several seconds that repeats in an endless loop.<br>
                - Try to tell some sort of story.<br>
                - To make things easier, have functions that move the various parts in your scene.<br><br>

                *** Might be useful to use JSON Array values to hold the positions/text/attributes of the items in your scene. And then go through a loop using those values to display the content.<br><br>

                Optional, more advanced features: <br>

                Animating Sprite Sheets:<br>
                - MOST USEFUL: Very helpful tool (https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter) to cutup a sprite sheet. Might be useful to combine with this site (https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer) to rebuild the sprite sheet and get JSON values for the pieces.<br>
                - Useful tool (https://ezgif.com/split) to Split an Animated GIF into single frames <br>
                - Find images and sprite sheets online to mix and match to make an animated scene on the canvas.<br>
                - Convert some animated GIFs online into a sprite sheet. (https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite) <br>
                - If you like to draw, you can make your own sprite sheet from this website (https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer). <br>
                - Also available as a standalone program.(https://www.codeandweb.com/sprite-sheet-maker)<br>

                Have a form to ask:<br>
                - Their name using a text field  <br>
                - Have them select a color, from the color picker, to use for their background color <br>
                - Have them select a color, from the color picker, to use for their text color <br>
                - Use a slider to set the size of the text (from 12 to 48 px)   <br>
                - Have 3 radio button choices, for the fonts to allow for different fonts to display the text <br>
                - The program should automatically display the text in the size/color selected. So that means when you change text/font/size/color, the drawing function will need to be called. <br>
                - The program should remember all the information: Name, colors/size/font<br>
                - Have a reset button to reset the page to their default values: [ Default text: Blank | Default background color: White | Default text color: Black | Default size: 12

                - Have 5 buttons (or more) to make a music/sound effect machine. <br>
                - Have a series of buttons that are labeled. They should play a sound when clicked.<br> <br>
                - Try to make a box or something that holds the buttons, so to looks like a sound machine. You are welcomed to use an <a href="https://www.image-map.net/">Image Map</a> tool to place links on an image (of a sound machine) if you want it to look more realistic. Here is how <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_imagemap.asp">Image Maps</a> work. Even use <a href="https://cooltext.com/"> Cool Text </a>> to make fancy text if you like.

        <div id="Voice Recognition" class="tabcontent">
            <h4>Voice Recognition</h4>
            <p style="font-size:smaller;">Instructions: <br>
                Speech will not work on your computer by opening up the file in your web browser. You will need to upload to a web server.<br> 
                Use Chrome for this lab. <br>

                On a 600x600 pixel canvas draw an arc (circle) in the very center of the canvas with a radius of 25 and the fillStyle of black. When the user enters in a diameter value adjust that for the radius value used in the program.
                <br>

                Offer the users:
                Have a button with that with the value of "Speak". When the user clicks on that button the value changes to "Stop"<br>
                Have your program respond to the following words or phrases:<br>
                Have on the screen instructions that list the following, but write so it looks like instructions for a user:<br>
                -   Say "color _____" to change the color of the circle. For example "color blue" to make the circle blue.<br>
                -   Say "size _____" to change the size of the circle. For example "size 50" to make the circle with a diameter of 50.<br>
                    -   If someone says something larger than 300 (or whatever looks too big on the screen) speak back "Size size limit 300".<br>
                    -   If someone says something smaller than 1, say "Size too small, the minimize size is 1".<br>
                    -   String to Int: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp<br>
                        Test the value for NaN to see if the value is valid for the size.<br>
                -   Say "Help" to tell them "Say color, followed by a color, to set the circle color. Say size, followed of a number from 1 to 300, to set the diameter of the circle."
                <br>
                Use variables to hold the color and size values, so you can set them separately from the drawing function.
                <br>
                If they ask for an invalid color, JavaScript ends up not changing the color and uses the previous fillStyle. You can always set the fillStyle first to "Black" and then set it to the value that the user speaks. This way if they speak an invalid color, the circle still appears in Black.
                <br>
                When the user presses the Speak button, have the program listen and stop when the user stops speaking (which is automatic) or if they press "Stop".
                <br>
                When the user stops speaking, or pressed "Stop", change the button's value to "Speak" so that the user can speak again.
                <br>SpeechRecognition.abort(): Stops the speech recognition service from listening to incoming audio, and doesn't attempt to return a SpeechRecognitionResult.
                <br>SpeechRecognition.start(): Starts the speech recognition service listening to incoming audio with intent to recognize grammars associated with the current SpeechRecognition.
                <br>SpeechRecognition.stop(): Stops the speech recognition service from listening to incoming audio, and attempts to return a SpeechRecognitionResult using the audio captured so far.
                <br><br>
                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/onresult

                <br>Set continuous to be false, but start the recognition again, if you want to keep listening for more commands. Otherwise try the continuous feature, but I found it easier to start the recognition after it stopped.

                I recommend you select a small dataset, so it's easy to work with. If you find a large dataset, select the top 10 items, and look for a column value to focus on. Such as top grades in schools.
